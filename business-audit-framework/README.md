# Relay▸Launch Business Audit Framework

## What This Is

Most businesses know something is off. They're busy but not growing. Revenue looks healthy but profit margins are shrinking. The team is working hard but the same problems keep coming back. The issue isn't effort. It's visibility.

The Business Audit Framework gives you that visibility. It's a structured diagnostic toolkit that evaluates operational health, growth trajectory, and strategic positioning using a repeatable, evidence-based methodology. Each checklist is designed to expose root causes, not symptoms. A business that "feels busy" may score poorly on workflow efficiency. A business with strong revenue may reveal fragile customer retention. This framework makes those realities visible and actionable.

## Who Should Use This

- **Relay▸Launch consultants** conducting client engagements, discovery sessions, or quarterly business reviews
- **Small business owners** performing self-assessments before seeking outside help or making strategic investments
- **Operations managers** benchmarking internal processes against best practices
- **Fractional COOs and advisors** who need a structured intake process for new clients

## Core Methodology

The framework follows a four-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Discovery Audit

Run through each checklist relevant to the engagement scope. Every item is evaluated honestly, not aspirationally. The goal is to capture the current state, not the intended state. Each item receives a score from 1 (Critical Gap) to 5 (Optimized) using the scoring rubric provided.

### Phase 2: Scoring and Benchmarking

Individual item scores roll up into category scores, which roll up into an overall Business Health Score. This score is not a grade. It is a diagnostic instrument. A score of 2.8 does not mean the business is failing; it means specific areas need attention and the framework will tell you which ones.

### Phase 3: Priority Matrix

Audit findings are mapped onto an effort-versus-impact matrix. This prevents the common mistake of fixing easy but low-impact problems while ignoring difficult but transformational ones. The priority matrix produces a ranked action list that respects both the business's capacity for change and the urgency of each finding.

### Phase 4: Action Planning

The ranked findings become a 30/60/90-day action plan. Quick wins (low effort, high impact) are scheduled first. Strategic initiatives (high effort, high impact) are scoped and sequenced. Low-impact items are deprioritized or eliminated. This phase is where the audit becomes a roadmap.

## How to Conduct an Audit

### Step 1: Select Scope

Not every engagement requires every checklist. A business struggling with lead generation needs the Digital Presence and Customer Journey audits. A business with operational chaos needs the Operations audit. A business that has plateaued needs the Revenue and Growth audit. Choose based on the presenting problem, but consider running all four for a comprehensive baseline.

### Step 2: Gather Evidence

Before scoring, collect the raw materials. This includes:

- Access to the business's tools (CRM, project management, analytics, accounting)
- Interviews with the owner and at least two team members (if applicable)
- Review of the last 12 months of financial data
- Screenshots or access to all customer-facing digital properties
- Documentation of existing SOPs, if any exist

### Step 3: Score Each Item

Walk through each checklist item and assign a score using the scoring rubric in `scoring/scoring-rubric.md`. Add notes for any item scored 3 or below. These notes become the foundation of the action plan.

### Step 4: Calculate the Health Score

Use the CLI tool (`tools/audit-score-calculator.py`) or calculate manually using the methodology described in the scoring rubric. The tool will generate a formatted report with category breakdowns and priority flags.

### Step 5: Build the Priority Matrix

Transfer all items scored 3 or below into the priority matrix template (`scoring/priority-matrix.md`). Estimate effort and impact for each. This produces the ranked action list.

### Step 6: Deliver Findings

Present the audit results with three components:

1. **The Health Score.** A single number that captures overall business health.
2. **The Category Breakdown.** Where strengths and weaknesses live.
3. **The Priority Action List.** What to fix first, second, and third.

## Scoring Overview

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Critical Gap | This area is absent or actively causing harm to the business |
| 2 | Significant Weakness | Functionality exists but is unreliable, inconsistent, or far below standard |
| 3 | Functional | Meets minimum requirements but has clear room for improvement |
| 4 | Strong | Well-executed with minor refinements possible |
| 5 | Optimized | Best-in-class execution; focus shifts to maintenance and iteration |

## Interpreting the Overall Health Score

| Range | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 1.0 – 1.9 | **Crisis**: The business has foundational issues that threaten viability. Immediate intervention required. |
| 2.0 – 2.9 | **Unstable**: The business is functioning but significant gaps create risk and limit growth. Focused remediation needed. |
| 3.0 – 3.4 | **Developing**: Core operations work but the business is leaving meaningful value on the table. Strategic improvements will accelerate growth. |
| 3.5 – 3.9 | **Solid**: The business is well-run with specific areas for optimization. Fine-tuning and scaling are the priorities. |
| 4.0 – 4.4 | **Strong**: High-performing across most dimensions. Focus on the remaining gaps and scaling what works. |
| 4.5 – 5.0 | **Optimized**: Operating at or near best-in-class. Shift focus to innovation, market expansion, and maintaining standards. |

## Principles

1. **Measure the actual, not the aspirational.** Score what exists today, not what is planned or intended.
2. **Root causes over symptoms.** A missed deadline is a symptom. The absence of a project management system is the root cause.
3. **Impact over activity.** Posting on social media daily is activity. Generating qualified leads from social media is impact.
4. **Capacity-aware recommendations.** A two-person business cannot execute a 47-item action plan. Prioritize ruthlessly.
5. **Progress over perfection.** Moving from a 2 to a 3 is more valuable than moving from a 4 to a 5. Focus on the biggest gaps first.
